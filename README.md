## Current state of development

The development is in alpha state at the moment. At the moment you can only read messages. There are no notifications yet! 

I noticed that not all send messages are available over the used API. It seems there are other channels the original apps use. Needs more investigation...

Still you can miss the apocalypse so!

## Version 0.3+
Starting with Version 0.3 the application needs at least SailfishOS 4.2.
If you use an older version of SailfishOS use app version 0.2.4 instead

## Requirements (0.3+)
- You need to enable the repository of rinigus to install the Mapbox GL Native QML component for map display or simply install PureMaps.

## Map View
If you have a own Mapbox API Key please use this. You can provide it in the application settings.

## Implemented Features
Here is a list of all implemented features so far.

- Read messages from DWD, MOWAS, BIWAPP, KATWARN (not all available!)
